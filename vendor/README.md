This directory includes a full version of TestU01 as provided by the authors, as
well as a way to compile it using Dune, producing in the end all the `*.h` files
and a `testu01.vendor` “OCaml” library containing the `*.a` and `*.so`. This is
only meant to be used to compile the bindings in the rest of the repository.
